 Predicting Appliances energy consumption using supervised machine learning algorithm
 
 Energy prediction is in high importance for smart homes and smart cities, since
it helps reduce power consumption and provides better energy and cost savings.
Many algorithms have been used for predicting energy consumption using data
collected from wireless sensors. In this project, we propose a system to predict
energy consumption of a building using collected information (e.g., light energy,
day of the week, humidity, temperature, etc.) from a Wireless Sensor Network
(WSN). We compare our system against other regression algorithms,
namely: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest(RF), KNN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost. We achieve state-of-the-art
results with 64% of the coefficient of Determination R2, 10.07 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and  241.41 Mean Squared error in the testing set.
